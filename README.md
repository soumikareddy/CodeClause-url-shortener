# CodeClause-url-shortener
A url shortener reduces the number of characters in a URL,making it easier to remember and share
The short URL is a practical help for forwarding a link, for eg if you want to deliver a link to contact by email, to share it on social networks or a mobile device
The idea is to minimize the web page address into something that is easier to remember and track
